## Python Conventions
### From [PEP 8: Function and Variable Names](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names)
- Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
- Variable names follow the same convention as function names.
