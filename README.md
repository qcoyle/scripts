Note: older scripts were imported from a private repo. I can provide their commit histories if needed

## To run scripts in Visual Studio
- Download visual studio
- Open python file in visual studio
- Click play button on top bar

- To make sure the play button runs script using python 3, open settings.json and set: "python": "python3 -u"
